_This is an assignment essay I wrote for the online course [America's Written Constitution](https://www.coursera.org/course/awc)_.

From its opening three words–_We the people_–the US Constitution announces itself as a historically unprecedented democratic document.
Unlike earlier efforts from other countries, such as England's Bill Of
Rights that was passed by an act of parliament in 1689[^1], the Constitution was
voted on by the wider population. And by a larger percentage of the population than had ever been able
to participate: property rights were waived for the constitutional vote.

Curiously, while the Constitution provided that the House of Representatives be
chosen "by the People", it did not actually include any voting rights itself.
This was left to the States, who were able to set their own voting
requirements. This omission had a long reach, with discrimination against black voters likely deciding the 2000 election[^9], and controversial voter ID laws being rules constitional by the Supreme Court as recently as 2008[^8].

That said, the Constitution did enshrine democratic requirements for those
being voted for.
Property ownership is not mentioned, and Article VI explicitly states that:

> no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or
public Trust under the United States.

Minimum ages were set for
representatives, senators and the president (25, 30, and 35 years
respectively). This was to avoid gross cases of nepotism,
such as the then contemporary English Prime Minister William Pitt "The Younger".
He was just 24 when he took office, which attracted much public ridicule at the
time[^2]. It was thought that an age requirement would ensure representatives
"should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these
advantages"[^3], and restricting eligibility would increase the chance of
elections based on merit rather than lineage. 

In hindsight, the framers may have been more democratically prudent to comment on campaign
financing. In 2012, 95% of house elections went to candidates that outspent
their opponents[^4]. The presidential candidates that same year both spent over
1 _billion_ dollars.[^5] In 1787 the US was the most democratic nation in the
world; in one index it is now ranked 15<sup>th</sup>[^6].

But this criticism is by modern standards. The Constitution
was certainly progressively democratic by the standards of the 1700s.

The Constitution was also very concerned with national security. Its preamble specifies the purpose of the document as
enabling the formation of a "perfect Union", to "insure domestic Tranquility"
and "provide for the common defence". It authorizes congress
to "raise and support armies", "provide and maintain a navy", and "[call] forth
the Militia" to "repel Invasions" (art. I, § 8). the President is
"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the
Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the
United States" (art. II, § 2).

In addition to this national defence force, John Jay argued at the time that unifying the states was inherently safer, as they would pick fewer fights with others and between themselves.

> It becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America; for if it should turn out that United America will probably give the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.[^7]

Within the Constitution, the allowances for national security are in tension
with its democratic ideals. The framers realised that this is necessary:
neither is possible without the other. A national defence is useful for
repelling invasion, but can also be abused by a tyrannical government against
the people. The constitution explicitly recognises this by placing
restrictions on standing armies. A majority of congress is required to approve
any offensive war, and monetary appropriations for armies must be affirmed by
congress every two years (art. I, § 8). The original text infers that states are expected to
keep their own militias ("the Militia of the several States"), and this was
quickly reinforced by the Second Amendment protecting the "right to bear arms"
for the purposes of a "well-regulated militia".

In being voted on by the people, lowering the requirements for office, and its novel national security provisions, in 1789 the US Constitution was the most democratic deed of its type. It set
an important standard for all nations to come.
