wow, this is definitely unintuitive!

> "A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is 'partially nude,' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing, [...] the two alleged victims here were not in a place and circumstance where they reasonably would or could have had an expectation of privacy.”

Privacy is fascinating here. I would expect that what is under my pants could reasonably considered private...

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I tried some research! _Disclaimer: this is literally the first time I have tried doing this..._

I first found the case report [467 Mass. 371 (2014)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17431626375901598207&q=Massachusetts+upskirt&hl=en&as_sdt=2006) by finding out the defendant's name then combining it with "upskirting". Robertson was charged with attempting to commit a crime under [G. L. c. 274, § 6](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter274/Section6) (state law), which sets limits on punishment on such attempts. The alleged crime in question was [G. L. c. 272, § 105](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter272/Section105), which is where the "partially nude" thing comes from. It actually includes a definition of that term: "the exposure of the human genitals, buttocks, pubic area or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola." Text of that law:

> Whoever willfully photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils another person who is nude or partially nude, with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity, when the other person in such place and circumstance would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed, videotaped or electronically surveilled, and without that person’s knowledge and consent, shall be punished by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than 21/2 years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

The judge's interpretation of this was:

> Contrary to the Commonwealth's view, § 105 (b) does not penalize the secret photographing of partial nudity, but of "a person who is ... partially nude" (emphasis added). "Is" denotes a state of a person's being, not a visual image of the person. 

However did note in the conclusion that:

> At the core of the Commonwealth's argument to the contrary is the proposition that a woman, and in particular a woman riding on a public trolley, has a reasonable expectation of privacy in not having a stranger secretly take photographs up her skirt. The proposition is eminently reasonable, but § 105 (b) in its current form does not address it.

I think this is an important point. It says: the role of the court is to apply the law as written. It is up to the legislature to revise it. The footnote to this paragraph notes provisions in other states that explicitly ban this type of activity, and reference a [bill previously introduced](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/188/House/H1231) that would have prevented it!

Sure enough, not long after this finding the bill was pushed through, such that this behaviour is now illegal in MA:

```
3/20/2014 House Reporting date extended to Monday June 30, 2014, pending concurrence
4/3/2014  Senate  Senate concurred
```

(I don't really understand those terms yet, but [news reports](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/07/nation/la-na-nn-upskiriting-banned-massachusetts-20140307) explain it in plain english.)

Apparently this [law has been applied since](http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/25/us/upskirting-arrest-boston/) against Joshua Gonsalves, but I can't find anything on google scholar. The amendments haven't been reflected in the law per above link, and the "status" of the bill is empty. Does anyone know how this part works?
