I read sixty books this year, [six fewer than last](2013-reading-list.html). You can find the full list over at [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2014&view=covers&per_page=100). Here are my top picks.

## Non-fiction

#### The Glass Cage _by Nicolas Carr_

What if the cost of machines that think is people who donâ€™t? An important read
for everyone in tech. I [reviewed this in full](the-glass-cage-review.html)
earlier in the year.

#### This Changes Everything _by Naomi Klein_

Damning yet inspiring book about the state of our climate. It savages everyone
from fossil fuel companies to futurists to billionaire do-gooders, before
turning in the second half to cover the many successes of climate movements
around the world.

#### The Hard Thing About Hard Things _by Ben Horowitz_

Perhaps the best business book I've read. I'm not usually a fan of blog post
collections, but there is enough glue and cohesion to make it work.

## Skills

#### Non-violent Communication _by Marshall Rosenberg_

Rosenberg has well over three decades of experience coaching difficult
conversations. He delivers it well. Goes well beyond just talking about
feelings.

#### Several short sentences about writing _by Verlyn Klinkenborg_

I didn't rate this so highly when I first read it, but it has had a lasting
impact on my writing. The sentence critiques in the final chapter are
particularly enjoyable.

## Law

I became interested in Law this year after stumbling across the excellent
[Surveillance Law](https://www.coursera.org/course/surveillance) subject on
Coursera. Naturally, I read some books about it.

#### The Legal Analyst _by Ward Farnsworth_

Great introductory book. Frames many familiar concepts (such as cognitive
biases) within the context of law.

#### Reflections on Judging _by Richard Possner_

Possner has been an appeals judge for over thirty years. His opinions are
pertinent and entertaining.

## Fiction

I made a successful effort to read more fiction this year. I doubled my rate
from last year, up to 30%. Fiction is great!

#### The Narrow Road to the Deep North _by Richard Flanagan_

Made me realise how long it has been since I read any Australian literature.
Pretty dark and depressing.

#### A Fine Balance _by Rohinton Mistry_

Set in 1975 India, during the state emergency and forced sterilizations.
Another amazingly depressing novel I couldn't put down.

#### Cat's Cradle _by Kurt Vonnegut_

Time for something funny! I'm not generally a huge Vonnegut fan, so was
surprised how much I enjoyed this.

#### Self-Help _by Lorrie Moore_

The first Moore book I've read, and I plan to read more. Funny and sad all at
the same time.

## Bonus Section: Documentaries

In addition to reading, I watched a number of documentaries this year. The standouts were all by Marshall Curry. I reviewed [_If A Tree Falls_](http://localhost:4000/blog/articles/if-a-tree-falls.html) previously, and [_Street Fight_](http://www.marshallcurry.com/street_fight.html) and [_Racing Dreams_](http://www.marshallcurry.com/racing_dreams.html) were also both excellent.

Josh Fox's [_Gasland_](http://www.palacefilms.com.au/gasland/) earns an
honourable mention, which I watched as part of a [fracking
binge](fracking.html) back in October.
